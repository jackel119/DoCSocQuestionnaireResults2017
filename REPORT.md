DoCSoc Member Experience Survey 2017 Report
================================

Hello there, lovely members of DoCSoC! Back in April, we asked you to fill out a survey for us regarding your experience with DoCSoc this past year. Well, we've taken a long hard look at the data and the results have been very educational for us and will certainly aid us in trying to improve DoCSoc as a community and society for this upcoming year.

Anyways, we'd just like to take this chance to show you the results and talk about some of the responses!

## The split between Academic and Social Events

This was a surprisingly good result - I mean, look at those sexy curves on that almost-Gaussian-Distribution! This was something we were initially somewhat concerned with, as we've previously heard complaints (from both sides) before. However, it looks like our concerns were unfounded......

On a more serious note, we'll continue to work hard to bring you a large range of both social and academic events this upcoming year, so stay tuned!

## Events this year

__Bar Nights__ were by far the most popular events - with over 80 responses mentioning either a specific bar night or all of them collectively. This was a *shocking* revelation to us as we would never have expected that large quantities of free alcohol could be so incredibly popular amongst university students. We're glad that DoCSoc's bar nights have gained the popularity and legendary reputation that they have; in fact the College Union has now asked us to switch our venue to Metric due to the large volumes of attendees. Our commitment to getting you alcohol will not waver, and you can expect the very same high quality bar nights this year!

At the same, Bar Nights were _also_ the most disliked, with over 30 people putting them down as their least favourite event:

_"Im not that interested in drinking."_

_"Boring as most club and societies do this already"_

_"Union bar is too overcrowded and the service is incredibly slow"_

_"Too many dudes"_

_"bar nights and alcohol arent really my thing!"_

_"I don't drink"_

_"dont like going to pubs"_

That said, some of the "Least favourite" reasons were:

_"Had too much to drink :("_

_"I died (was lit otherwise)"_

*It's no surprise that the Bar Nights are the most controversial events - after all, we're a very diverse community of people ranging from raging alcoholics to complete teetolers. After much debate, we've come to the consensus that the bar nights are in a good spot right now, and we will keep the number of bar nights for this upcoming year the same as last year. This doesn't mean that we're not listening to the non-drinkers; we believe we can up our game with non-alcohol social events this year without affecting the quality of the Bar Nights which are beloved by many others. We'd also like to mention that this year we'll be moving to Metric for our main Bar Nights. This should hopefully solve or mitigate a lot of issues with the congestion and long bar queues.*

**ICHack** was by far the most expensive event and took months of preparation from the committee, and it's good to see that our hard work has been appreciated with the hackathon being voted to 2nd place. Our ambitions were very high this year, going from a measly 150 attendees in the previous ICHack to a staggering 335, so we're _really_ happy that you guys enjoyed it as much as the committee almost died organizing.

_"It was organised extremely well and was really fun"_

_"Really huge event. Free food. Great prizes. Great sponsors and establish career connections."_

_"Because Pizza. Also first Hackathon so a really cool experience. The sponsors were also super nice!"_

_"Most exciting of all the events, I had a great time and learnt a lot as well"_

_"God organization"_

_"Lit af"_

 Thanks guys <3

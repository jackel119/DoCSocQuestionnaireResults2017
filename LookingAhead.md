As we head into the next year, DoCSoc is excited to announce a few changes:

As part of our initiative to reduce costs, DoCSoc will no longer be providing pizza. Instead, all events will now come with a selection of Tesco's Meal Deals.

&hellip; we're just kidding. Pizza will still be provided, but after some serious trialling, we've decided to part ways with Domino's and go with Papa John's.

**Attendance statistics** are something we'd like to start looking more into this year. We're still in the early stages of discussion, but the leading concept is a system where attendees tap into events with their College IDs (those who wish not to will still be permitted entry). The data collected will be used by the committee in analyzing which events are popular and various other data-sciencey stuff which I don't really know yet.
